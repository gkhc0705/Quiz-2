# Quiz-2

In this quiz, we had to create several files to validate correct IP Address and count the users.

1.Create a folder named UNIX_NAME (for me, it would be UNIX_TASSIA).

2.Create a shell script named update.sh to be run as a regular user, that updates the local list of packages and upgrade all the packages of your system to the most recent version available.

3.Create a script named ip.sh (could be ip.pl, or ip.py depending on the language of your choice) to validade ip addresses. Base your solution in regular expressions. A valid ip address is composed by 4 numbers from 1 to 255 separated by dots. For instance, 192.168.2.1, 200.8.233.27, 1.1.1.1 are valid addresses, and aa.3.4.5 and 4.5.6 are invalid ones.

4. Create a script named users.sh (could be users.pl, or users.py depending on the language of your choice) to count how many users can login to your system. The script should use the file containing information about users, and check how many users have a valid shell associated with the account.

5. Create a text file named services.txt and answer the following questions: what is a service in a UNIX system? if you have a script called myservice.py that performs a particular action, what do you need to do to have it started every time your system starts?
